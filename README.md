VISUAL PATHFINDING

This project aims for a visual representation of the **result(!)** of the A-Star algorithm with JavaFX. <br>**(The process of the algorithm itself (heuristics, visited fields etc...) will not be visualized)**<br>
The Goal is that the "player" can select a start and a target point on a map full of obstacles.
After that a robot will walk the shortest path between those two points.

**Current State:**<br>
JavaFX:<br>
-Playground can be rendered<br>
-Mouse following field marker implemented
<br>A-Star:<br>
-implemented and tested
